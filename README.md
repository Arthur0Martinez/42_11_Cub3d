The Cub3D project introduces to the fundamentals of computer graphics and game development using the raycasting technique. The main objective is to create a basic 3D game engine similar to the early first-person shooters (like Wolfenstein 3D). This project helps students understand graphical rendering, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.
